Add change log

Add activerecord helper: (maybe it's better to add somewhere else parsi-localize for example)

class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  # this must add :parsi_released_at accessors and sync with original attribute
  has_parsi_date_for :released_at

  # can have an optional name
  has_parsi_date_for :lifecycel_ended_at, as: 'end_of_life'
